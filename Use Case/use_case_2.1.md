##### General Information
_________________________

Place of study: Southwest University China Xinshi Institute.

Setup: Participant required to visit lab twice over a period of 1 month. 

Recruitment: Online advertisement. 


** Selected Quasi Identifiers ** Age, Gender, Weight, Height 

Top 10 SUDA scores. 

2 participants specially stands out, due to their combination of height & weight.<br>

The Privacy Information factor partically reflects the suda score but rates row 58 and 59 higher than SUDA.<br>

Taking a look at the heatmap for the field information gain, it is shown that weight and height creates the most data risk within the dataset.<br>

Looking at the data risk in isolation in can seem as though this data could carry potential data risks. However taking into consideration the overall population being 32.05M individuals living in the city of which this study takes place it is highly undoubtful that the limited amount of quasi-identifers would consitute a risk to release.
